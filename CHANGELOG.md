# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Experience levels for guitar/ukulele shapes (`@pepperhorn/chordl-guitar`, `@pepperhorn/chordl-react`).** Every looked-up shape now carries a rung on a `beginner` → `emerging` → `established` ladder — "can I play this yet" — derived from its facts (open/barre/position) or, for top-3 voicings, from the shape itself. New in `chordl-guitar`: `EXPERIENCE_LADDER`, `levelForFacts`, `levelForTop3`, `selectForExperience` and `selectForResult` (cumulative level matching with shape-class refinement, relaxing one rung at a time rather than showing nothing), and a required `levels: ExperienceLevel[]` field on `GuitarChordResult` plus a required `level` on `StaticPreset`. `GuitarChordPanel` (`chordl-react`) gains `level`/`onLevelChange` props and a Beginner/Emerging/Established toggle next to the instrument switch, and a new `frets` prop lets a host request a wider fret window than the shape's own floor.

### Changed

- **The "Hide barre shapes" switch is gone, replaced by the level toggle.** The one-off barre filter documented under the 2026-09-01 release no longer exists as a control; its job — offering an easier alternative shape rather than showing nothing — is now done more generally by the Beginner/Emerging/Established level toggle above, which also covers position-on-the-neck, not just barres.

## 2026-09-01 — first six-package release

Published from `e63c630`. Everything documented below this heading shipped in
this release; it had been accumulating under "Unreleased" since 0.3.5.

| Package | Version | |
|---|---|---|
| `@pepperhorn/chordl-voicings` | 0.4.0 | breaking — dominant and diminished qualities stop resolving to minor voicings; `M7b5` becomes its own chord |
| `@pepperhorn/chordl-guitar` | 0.2.0 | first publish; breaking — `OPEN_STRING_MIDI` removed in favour of `INSTRUMENTS[id].openMidi` |
| `@pepperhorn/chordl-listen` | 0.1.0 | first publish |
| `@pepperhorn/chordl-core` | 0.4.0 | adds hand-reach constraints (`constrainVoicing`) |
| `@pepperhorn/chordl-react` | 0.4.0 | breaking — ESM-only, CJS build dropped, runtime dependencies externalised |
| `@pepperhorn/chordl-board` | 0.1.0 | first publish |

Listed in publish order. All six must go out together: `chordl-react` now
imports the other packages at runtime instead of inlining them, so publishing it
ahead of them yields a package that fails to install.

Upgrading from `0.3.x` — read **"chordl-react — ship dependencies instead of
inlining them"** and **"chordl-guitar 0.2.0"** below first. `chordl-react` is
now ESM-only and expects `react` / `react-dom` to be supplied by the consumer.

### chordl-core / chordl-react — note-name and degree sizes are independent

"note names in xl with degrees in lg" is one request carrying two sizes, and the
editor's detail panel offers a control for each — but both were written to
`noteNameSize`, so the second overwrote the first and **the note names came out
silently demoted to the degrees' size**. Every card written that way, including
whole boards of them, drew at the wrong size with no way to tell.

`degreeSize` is now its own field, carried from the parser through `PianoChord`
to `PianoKeyboard`. The degree row keeps the 0.85 factor that has always marked
it as secondary to the name row, so the size chosen for it scales that
relationship rather than replacing it; a degree-only chord takes its size
directly, since there the degree *is* the label row. Absent, it falls back to
the note-name size — what every caller did before it existed.

The downloaded SVG and PNG carry the size too. That path draws from a JSON
payload rather than the DOM and recomputed the degree row as `0.85 x` the note
names, so a chord that sized its degrees separately drew one way on screen and
another in the file.

Two clauses that each carry a size must not be able to read each other's, in
either direction. `NOTE_NAMES_RE` accepts a size *before* its keyword ("xl note
names"), so "with degrees in base note names in 2xl" read the degrees' "base" as
the note-name size; the degrees clause accepts one *after* its own ("degrees
xl"), so "degrees 2xl note names" swallowed a size that belonged to the note
names. A bare size between the two now goes to the keyword it precedes, and only
the explicit "degrees in xl" form binds it to the degrees.

### chordl-core — "midi note names" is no longer read as part of the chord

`MIDI_NAMES_RE` was read for its mode and size but never stripped from the
residual the chord extractor works on, so the word "midi" reached it — and it is
not inert there. `CHORD_RE`'s quality class contains `m`, so **"C with midi note
names" rendered Cm**; the same for D, E, F and G. Worse, a root of A is
article-shaped, so it was eaten as one and the extractor found its root in the
`d` of "mi**d**i": **"A with midi note names" rendered D**. Every case drew a
real but different chord, with no error.

The clause now leaves with the rest of the request, ahead of `NOTE_NAMES_RE`
(which matches the "note names" half on its own and would strand "midi"), and a
loose "midi" goes with it — a bare "midi" is already read as the request.

### chordl-core — a bare A survives the modifiers written after it

Fixing the above exposed the rest of the family. The article guard tested for
the true end of the string, but filler is stripped after every modifier has been
cut out, so **"A with note names", "A in second inversion" and "A compact" all
reached that test as "A " — an article by the old rule, and eaten**, leaving no
chord at all.

The trap in fixing it is that the residual cannot tell the two apart: "in a
compact layout" arrives as "A " just as "A with note names" does, because the
article's own noun is one of the things that was stripped. So the article pass
decides on evidence the stripping cannot invent — what follows the token (`#`
or `/`), the capital letter the user typed, and whether the article ended the
original input. A trailing lowercase "a" whose noun was deleted stays an
article, so a note-list or scale card never grows a phantom A chord.

That also fixes the other half of the family, where the word after the root is
not strippable filler and the article pass ate the root before the descriptive
matcher could see it: **"A minor" resolved to no chord at all, "A minor seventh"
to E, "A dominant seventh" to D and "A flat" to B.**

### chordl-board — cards can be resized on the board

A card's hover controls gain a size strip — `sm md rg lg xl 2xl` — where `rg` is
one column and the size every card was before this existed. A size decides two
things at once: how much of the row the card takes (½, ¾, 1, 1½, 2 or 3
columns) and how big its diagram draws. They cannot come apart, or the extra
width would be empty paper.

Rows are packed by width rather than by card count, so a card too wide for what
is left starts the row it fits in, and a row that does not fill the board is
centred. A size the card's row cannot hold is shown greyed rather than hidden —
which sizes exist should not change with where a card happens to sit, and a
size control that silently reflowed the board is not a size control. The size a
card already is is never greyed, so a card can always show what it is.

The grid runs on 480 tracks: the smallest count where every size at every
column count, and half of every row's leftover width, lands on a whole track.

`size` rides along in exported JSON and is part of a card's cache key — the same
chord at `sm` and at `xl` is a different image.

### chordl-react — editing a card restores the detail panel it was made with

A chord card stores its annotations inside its own string: "C note names in xl
with degrees in lg". Opening one for edit put that whole string in the input box
and reset every toggle, so the detail panel read empty for a card that plainly
had details — and the first toggle touched appended a clause the string already
carried, giving "note names in lg note names in lg".

`splitChordDetails` is now the exact inverse of the composer that writes those
modifiers, and both live in one module (`src/editor/chordDetails.ts`) so they
cannot drift. Editing a card fills the input with the chord alone and restores
note names, degrees, fingering and octave shift — mode and size included — to
what the card was made with.

A clause only sets a toggle if it was removed from the text, so the two can
never both claim it. Anything the split does not recognise stays in the input:
"Cmaj7#5 starting on G#" belongs to the user, not to the form.

### chordl-react — an octave shift moves the keyboard's window, not its width

`chord up 1 octave` extended the keyboard by a whole octave — eight white keys
became fifteen — and put the chord at the far right of it. On a board the
oversized diagram was then shrunk to fit its card and drawn as a letterboxed
strip, so a shifted card matched none of its neighbours.

The keyboard is a window onto the chord, not a ruler measuring how far it
moved: it now stays the size the chord needs and the highlights sit where the
unshifted chord's do. The octave is carried where an octave belongs — the staff,
the MIDI note names under the keys (`C5` becomes `C6`), and playback, all
unchanged.

### chordl-board — a short row is centred instead of hugging the left edge

With a column count set, a row holding fewer cards than the setting — the one
before a break, or the last one — sat in the grid's leftmost tracks. Two cards
on a four-per-row board read as "a full row missing two" rather than as a row
of two.

The leftover columns are now split evenly either side, so a short row is
centred. Cards keep the width their column count gives them: a card is the same
size wherever it lands.

Column gutters moved onto the cards rather than the grid: at this track count
the grid's own gutters would be wider than the board.

### chordl-board — a selected card can be deselected

Selecting a card was one click; leaving the selection needed the strip of board
background around the grid, which a full board barely has, and a keyboard user
had no route at all. Clicking the selected card now deselects it, and Escape
clears the selection (except while the new-board overlay is up, where Escape
means "cancel that"). `onSelect` is called with `null` on the way out, so a
host can tell a deselect from a selection.

In the app, deselecting also leaves card editing: the highlight is what says
"your edits land here", and a form still bound to a card with no highlight is
the same bug seen from the other side.

### chordl-board — card controls stay inside the card, and duplicate replaces copy

Six controls in one non-wrapping row is wider than a card at small scales or in
a many-column layout, and a flex row does not shrink to fit — it spilled past
the card border. The row now wraps, and is centred rather than right-aligned so
a short second line does not hang off one edge.

`copy` and `repeat` are replaced by a single `duplicate`. `copy` only filled a
clipboard the user then had to paste; `repeat` did the whole job in one click,
so the clipboard round-trip was a longer road to the same card. `cut` still
fills the clipboard for a move, and `ChordBoard`'s `onCopy` prop is gone with
the control that drove it — `useChordBoard().copyItem` remains for hosts that
want their own.

### chordl-react — quality shortcuts for a bare root

Typing `A` renders A major immediately, which is the fastest path in the app,
but a bare letter is genuinely ambiguous and nothing said that `m`, `7` or
`maj7` were a keystroke away.

`ChordQualityPicker` puts a strip of seven shortcuts — `m · 7 · maj7 · m7 ·
dim · aug · sus4` — under the input whenever the parsed chord name is a bare
root. Seven, chosen by how often a learner meets them rather than by theory; the
row mixes triads and sevenths on purpose, because it is a shortcut, not a
taxonomy. Typing still reaches everything the resolver supports.

The check is on the *parsed* name, so "show me an A" gets the strip too, and a
click rewrites the editor input (`A` → `Am`) rather than rendering in place —
add-to-board, annotations, octave shift and board editing keep working with no
new plumbing. Scales, progressions and note lists are excluded.

### chordl-board — a way to start a new board

There was no way to empty a board short of deleting cards one at a time, which
the app's own image-quota error already assumed there was: it told users to
"start a new board" and left them no button for it.

`ChordBoard` gains an `onNew` prop and a **NEW** control beside PNG / PDF /
JSON / Import, disabled when there is nothing to clear. Clearing is
unrecoverable — no undo, and localStorage holds the only copy — so it goes
through an overlay offering *Download JSON & clear*, *Clear without saving* and
*Cancel*. Cancel takes focus on open, so an Enter left over from typing lands on
the harmless choice; Escape and a backdrop click cancel too.

The message counts the live cards and names what else goes, distinguishing a
board title (content the user wrote) from board settings (a column count), so it
never promises to clear something that is not there. The host clears via
`replaceState`, which resets cards and meta together — a title outliving the
cards it described is not a new board.

### chordl-voicings — inversions are the first alternatives offered

The A/B/C toggle mixed three tiers of voicings, and the library tier came
first: after the default, a learner's next two options for `Cmaj7` were a Shell
and a Rootless Type B — different sets of notes, not different arrangements of
the notes they had just asked for.

Inversions now fill the slots directly after the default, and the library and
algorithmic tiers follow. An inversion keeps every note the chord already has
and only moves the bass, so it is the smallest step away from what the user
typed, and the one worth meeting first. A style hint still owns slot A: asking
for a voicing by name is asking for that voicing.

For a four-note chord that is `Root position · 1st inv · 2nd inv · 3rd inv`
before anything else appears; the default count of three fills exactly with a
triad's root position and its two inversions.

### chordl-react — ship dependencies instead of inlining them

The Vite build externalised only `react`, `react-dom` and `react/jsx-runtime`,
so the other nine declared runtime dependencies — the four `@pepperhorn`
packages plus `tonal`, `svguitar`, `jszip`, `smplr` and `verovio` — were inlined
into the bundle *and* installed transitively. Consumers downloaded that code
twice and could end up running two copies of `chordl-core`. The external list is
now derived from the manifest, so anything declared as a dependency stays a
runtime import, subpaths included.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `dist/chordl.js` | 983.97 kB | 115.74 kB |
| `dist/` total | 19 MB | 1.2 MB |
| packed tarball | 6.52 MB | 0.74 MB |

**The CJS build is dropped; the package is ESM-only.** It only ever worked by
inlining — externalised, `dist/chordl.cjs` would `require()` packages that are
ESM-only. Nothing consumes it: `ph-chordl`, `chordcards` and `render-cli` are
all ESM, and `chordl-guitar` and `chordl-board` were already ESM-only.
The exports map gains the same terminal `"default"` condition as the rest
of the workspace.

**Release note: `chordl-react` can no longer be published on its own.** Its four
`@pepperhorn` dependencies used to be inlined, so a react-only publish worked
even though none of their current versions is on the registry. They are now
load-bearing runtime imports, and `pnpm publish` rewrites `workspace:*` to the
exact local version — so publishing `chordl-react@0.4.0` before them yields a
package that fails to install. All six must go out together, in dependency
order: voicings, guitar, listen, core, react, board.

Verified by installing the packed tarballs into a clean consumer, checking all
12 external specifiers resolve, and server-rendering `PianoChord` with
`react-dom/server` — one installed copy of `chordl-core`.

### All packages — valid Node ESM

Every `tsc`-built package declared `"type": "module"` but was compiled with
`moduleResolution: "bundler"`, so none of them actually loaded under Node's
ESM resolver. This was invisible because `chordl-react` inlined its workspace
dependencies at build time and every consumer went through a bundler, both of
which resolve what Node rejects. Three distinct faults:

- **Relative imports carried no file extension** — 126 specifiers across core,
  guitar, voicings, board and listen emitted as `from "./engine/keyboard-layout"`,
  which is `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in Node. Source now writes explicit `.js`, and
  core, voicings, guitar and listen moved to `moduleResolution: "nodenext"` so
  tsc enforces it rather than leaving it to convention. `chordl-board` stays on
  `bundler` — it is DOM-only and its CJS deps (`html2canvas`, `jspdf`) declare
  ESM-style default exports that nodenext types as non-callable — but its emit is
  equally correct, since the extensions are in the source.
- **`chordl-guitar` imported JSON with no import attribute**, which Node rejects
  with `ERR_IMPORT_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING`. Both now carry `with { type: "json" }`.
- **`chordl-core`, `chordl-voicings` and `chordl-listen` advertised
  `"main"`/`"require": "./dist/index.cjs"` — a file their build never produced.**
  `require()` of `chordl-core` and `chordl-voicings` has been broken in every
  published version since 0.3.0; `chordl-listen` has never been published, so it
  carried the same fault unreleased. They are ESM-only, and now say so, matching
  `chordl-guitar` and `chordl-board`. Every package also gained a terminal
  `"default"` export condition, so a resolver using a condition set without
  `"import"` falls back instead of failing outright.

`chordl-guitar` declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20.10" }`, the floor for the
import-attribute syntax its JSON imports now use — a parse error below that, and
better surfaced at install than at bundle time.

`chordl-board` carries a test asserting every relative specifier in its source
has an explicit extension. It is the one package tsc does not enforce this for,
and build, lint and the rest of the suite all resolve extensionless specifiers
happily — so nothing else would catch a regression before it shipped.

Verified by installing the packed tarballs into a clean consumer and importing
each package under plain Node ESM — previously three separate hard failures.

### chordl-guitar 0.2.0

**Breaking:** `OPEN_STRING_MIDI` is removed. Use `INSTRUMENTS[id].openMidi`,
which is chords-db index order (`openMidi[i]` is the string `frets[i]` refers
to) rather than svguitar's highest-pitch-first numbering.

- `positionToMidi(pos, openMidi)` derives sounding pitches from tuning and
  `baseFret`. Verified against all 4,183 chords-db positions. `capo` is a
  rendering hint and is ignored.
- `positionFacts` exposes bass note, inversion, note count, doubling, pitch
  classes and open/barre classification.
- `duplicateVoicingMap` flags chords-db's 63 redundant identical-sounding
  positions. Flagged, not removed — frames' `/api/frame` exposes a
  `positionIndex`.
- `canonicalPositionIndex` picks a default shape, instrument-aware: guitar
  prefers root position, ukulele ranks on lowest `baseFret`.
- `selectVoicings` returns a primary plus diversity-ranked alternates.
- `powerChordPosition` / `powerChordShape` generate movable power chords,
  which chords-db does not carry.
- New instruments: `bass4`, `bass5`. Lookup returns `null` — chords-db has no
  bass library.

### Added

- **A hand keyword can be followed by a chord symbol, not just notes** — `"rh Cmaj7 lh Dm7"` draws Cmaj7 in the right hand and Dm7 in the left, and hands can be mixed with note lists (`"rh c d e lh Am"`). Where two chords follow one hand, the first wins (`"rh Cmaj7 Dm7"` → Cmaj7). A bare pitch class still reads as a single note (`"lh Bb"`), while a symbol with a quality or extension reads as a chord (`"lh G7"`), matching how `"G7 in lh"` was already treated. `NotesGroup` carries the source symbol in a new optional `chord` field, which also names the card (`"Cmaj7 / Dm7"`).
- **Guitar & ukulele chord diagrams (`@pepperhorn/chordl-guitar`).** A new **Guitar** option on the Display toggle renders fretboard "frames" for a chord via svguitar, backed by `@tombatossals/chords-db`. A **Guitar / Ukulele** switch flips between the 6-string and 4-string (G C E A) instruments — the ukulele library spells accidental roots as flats (`Db`/`Gb`) where guitar uses sharps, and the lookup resolves either enharmonic spelling. Each chord's **alternate placements** (open, barre, higher positions) are browsable with an A/B/C toggle that shows the base fret. Based on the pepperhorn/frames project. The view (svguitar + shape library, ~200KB) is lazy-loaded, so it only ships when selected.
- **Live chord listener (`@pepperhorn/chordl-listen`).** A new package identifies chords from microphone input — mic → FFT chroma → template matching → stabilizer → chord symbol handed to chordl's resolver. A mic button in the input box opens a listen overlay that names the chord you're playing (with a keyboard preview) and keeps it on screen until a new chord is heard. **Save to board** captures the current chord; **Record** captures up to 60s and drops one board card per unique chord heard — a chord board for reference/teaching.
- **Follow-along page turning.** A **Follow along** button on a board of two or more chords opens a page-turner: the mic listens, matches what you play against the board's chords, and advances a highlighted cursor — turning the page automatically when the cursor crosses a page boundary. It's forward-only (a stray chord never jumps backwards), and you can also page manually. Built on `chordl-listen`'s `SequenceFollower`; the expected chords are normalized into the detector's vocabulary (flat roots folded to sharps, richer chords degraded to the nearest hearable voicing) so live detections line up.
- **Scales: "starting on" and multi-octave rotation.** `c major scale starting on G` now runs one octave from G (rotating the scale, enharmonic-aware), and `c major scale 2 octaves` extends it. Scales default to one octave from the root.
- **Notes: run-together sequences.** After the `notes` keyword you can write letters with no separators — `notes cdefgabc` → C D E F G A B C, `notes EbGbBb` → Eb Gb Bb (flats bind after uppercase letters), `notes E4G4C5` with octaves.
- **Verovio font zips.** Bravura and Petaluma are bundled in the repo as Verovio custom-font zips (`packages/chordl-react/fonts/verovio`) and registered via `fontAddCustom`.

- **Board cards keep the view they were created in.** A card added from the editor now renders as what you were looking at — guitar frame, notation, both, or keyboard — instead of always falling back to a piano diagram. `BoardItem` gains `display`, plus `instrument` and `position` for guitar cards, so a card remembers the instrument and the exact A/B/C fret placement you picked. One board can mix all four, and the fields survive JSON export/import, localStorage, and PNG/PDF export.

- **Power chords, top-3-string voicings and a barre filter in the guitar view.** `D5` now renders — chords-db has no `5` suffix, so the shapes are generated (root + fifth + octave, on the 6th- and 5th-string sets, verified by pitch class rather than fret pattern). **Guitar (top 3)** joins the instrument switch, backed by the 20 hand-authored three-string voicings. A **Hide barre shapes** switch filters the alternate placements, appearing only when a chord has both kinds, and saying so rather than rendering nothing when every shape needs a barre (`F`, `Bm`). All three capabilities already existed in `chordl-guitar` and were simply never called: `lookupGuitarChord` is now the single entry point for "shapes for this chord on this instrument", whichever source answers.

- **Text cards, icons and line breaks on boards.** A board is no longer a flat run of chords. **+ Text** adds a title/subtitle card for section headings ("Verse", "Chorus"), and **break** on any card starts a new row after it, so a sheet can be laid out in phrases rather than wherever the grid happens to wrap. A text card takes an **icon** — 16 built in: musical symbols (clefs, accidentals, repeat, fermata, coda, segno, notes) and objects (guitar, piano, mic, metronome, tuning fork) — or an **uploaded image**, whichever was chosen last. `BoardItem` gains `kind`, `icon`, `image` and `breakAfter`; `kind` is optional and absent means "chord", so every board saved before this keeps working with no migration. Text cards render through the same `CardHeading` as chord cards, so a mixed board still agrees on type. Exported JSON is now `chordl.board/v2` — `importBoardJson` still reads v1, so nothing saved before this stops opening, while a v2 board meeting an older build is refused by version rather than by a per-item error about a missing `nl`.
- **Board icons ship as inline SVG, not a webfont.** The musical glyphs are real Bravura outlines (SIL OFL 1.1, converted from the verovio font data already in the repo), so they need no `@font-face` from the host page, cannot race `html2canvas` during an export, and render identically wherever the board is embedded. Provenance in `packages/chordl-board/NOTICE.md`.

### Changed

- **Notation now engraved by Verovio.** The staff view renders through Verovio (MEI → SVG) instead of the hand-rolled SVG engraver, matching the notation stack used by the other apps. Chords keep their own spelling on the staff (a `Bb` chord shows flats, not sharps). Standard/Hand-drawn maps to Bravura/Petaluma.
- **`title` describes a card; it no longer replaces the chord name.** Every chord card shows its chord name automatically, with `title` rendered above it as a descriptive label ("bar 1 — turnaround"). Previously a `title` overrode the name, and keyboard cards showed no name at all unless the NL input asked for a heading. Keyboard, notation and fretboard cards now share one `CardHeading` so a mixed board agrees on type. Bare embedded diagrams are unchanged — the name is still opt-in there via `with heading`; cards request it with the new `showChordName` prop.
- **Notation cards render their card text.** `PianoChord`'s staff branch passes `title`, `subheading` and `footerText` through, and `StaffNotation` takes `showLabel` so a card can supply the name via the shared DOM heading instead of the in-SVG label.
- **"Both" cards center their text over the card** rather than over the keyboard half, and the staff/keyboard pair now wraps instead of compressing in a narrow card.

### Fixed

- **The hands are placed at least an octave apart, so the RH can't land on the LH's keys.** Giving each hand its own base octave (LH 3, RH 4) wasn't enough: a group's ascending-octave wrap can climb into the other hand's range — `"lh Dm7"` resolves D3 F3 A3 **C4**, exactly where `"rh Cmaj7"` starts — and `"rh c d e lh a b"` left only three semitones between the hands. The RH group is now lifted by whole octaves (its own shape untouched) until its lowest note is both an octave above the LH's lowest and clear of the LH's highest. Requests that pin octaves themselves (`"notes C3 E3 in lh and notes C4 E4 in rh"`) are placed exactly as written, and a bass/treble clef pair keeps the placement its clefs imply.
- **A left-hand note group no longer hides under the right-hand one.** `"rh c d e lh c e"` parsed both hands correctly but drew only three keys: every group with no explicit octave digits started at octave 4, so the LH notes landed on the exact keys the RH notes already held, with the L.H. bracket stacked on top of the R.H. one. A group whose hand is LH (and that names no clef) now starts at octave 3, the same base the bass clef already used. Hand order in the string never mattered and still doesn't — `"lh c e rh c d e"` renders identically.
- **A board that can no longer be saved now says so.** `localStorageAdapter.save` caught `QuotaExceededError` and dropped the write silently, so a full localStorage looked exactly like a working board until the tab was closed and the work was gone. It now reports through an `onError` callback — the app raises a dismissible warning suggesting a JSON export — and warns with the byte size when nothing handles it.
- **Uploaded card images cannot blow the storage budget.** An upload is downscaled to 640px and re-encoded before it ever reaches a card, and one that still would not fit is refused with its actual size and the limit rather than accepted and lost. PNG and WebP sources stay PNG: re-encoding a transparent image as JPEG blackens its background, which is the one outcome a user cannot undo.
- **Board cards no longer overlap in a multi-column layout.** Cards carried a 240px floor into a `minmax(0, 1fr)` grid, so asking for more columns than the board had room for made every card spill into its neighbour. The floor now applies only to the wrapping layout, where it is what stops a card collapsing to its content; in a grid the track sets the width.
- **Board PDFs are ~150x smaller.** A 12-card board exported at 5.95MB and a 30-card board at roughly 15MB. jsPDF defaults `compress` to false, so it embedded the decoded bitmap with no stream compression — the same board is now 0.04MB and 0.08MB. The image resolution was never the cause: the PNG itself was 0.12MB before and after. PNG is kept rather than switching to JPEG, which measured three times larger (chord diagrams are flat line art, which Flate compresses better) and would ring around staff lines.
- **Board exports no longer carry editing chrome.** A selected card's blue ring was captured into PNG and PDF output, because `isExporting` hid the drag handle and action row but nothing else. Card styling now separates editing chrome (selection, edit ring, drag glow, pulse) — which never reaches an export — from the card's own border, which is a print decision and defaults to off: an exported chord sheet is a page of chords, not a page of boxes. Geometry is unchanged, so what you see still matches what you get, and selection survives the export.
- **`c major scale` (and other scale requests) render through the batch pipeline** instead of failing with "Could not extract a chord name".
- **Fingering boxes accept arbitrary strings** (e.g. violin `D1`, `A1`) instead of a single character, and a non-numeral no longer throws an unrecoverable render error — each board card is isolated by its own error boundary.
- **`useChordBoard`'s `addItem` no longer drops card fields.** It copied a fixed list of properties, so anything added to `BoardItem` later was silently discarded on the way to the board; it now spreads the item.
- **A guitar card naming an unknown instrument degrades instead of blanking.** An imported board file or an older export could carry an instrument id this build doesn't have, which threw on `INSTRUMENTS[id].strings` and left an error tile. `GuitarChordPanel` resolves the id once and falls back to guitar.
- **A guitar card's chord name is no longer drawn twice** — once by the panel and once by svguitar's built-in diagram title, in a font it sized independently of the page.
- **Board PNG/PDF exports can't capture a loading placeholder.** `ChordBoard` imported the guitar panel lazily for a saving it never made (chordl-react ships as one bundle, so `PianoChord` already pulls in svguitar and chords-db), while its Suspense fallback was a live race with `html2canvas`. The import is now static.

### chordl-core

- **A chord tonal leaves unnamed now carries its canonical name.** `Cadd9`,
  `Cmadd9`, `CM7b5` and `C6#11` resolve to the right notes but tonal gives them
  `type: ""`, because those chord types carry aliases and no name. An empty type
  tells a consumer nothing, and it is the field `mapToVoicingQuality` reads to
  pick a voicing — so an add chord could be spelled correctly and still be
  voiced as nothing. The type now falls back to the first alias tonal lists for
  it. Notes, root and display name are unchanged; `add2`, `2` and `add9` all
  resolve to one name, as one chord should.

### chordl-core 0.4.0

- `constrainVoicing` fits a voicing to a hand, bounded by `maxSpanPerHand`
  (semitones) and `maxNotesPerHand` (count, minimum 2). Both are required:
  a 3-note cap alone still admits C-E-C' across a full octave.
- `generateConstrainedVariants` generates variants and fits each, returning
  those that satisfy the constraints first. An inversion often fits a reach
  root position cannot — Cmaj7 spans 11 semitones in root position, 8 in
  first inversion.
- Reduction folds octaves before dropping notes, and never drops an identity
  tone. The root is droppable as a last resort, which is how shell voicings
  are formed.
- `midiOf`, `placeAscending` and `spanOf` are exported for callers doing their
  own keyboard layout.

This lives in core rather than chordl-voicings because it needs
`classifyTones`/`dropOrder`; voicings is a leaf package that core depends on.

### chordl-voicings 0.4.0

`mapToVoicingQuality` classified a chord by searching its type name for
substrings, and several names contain the name of a different quality.

- **Dominant chords no longer render minor voicings.** `"dominant"` contains
  `"min"` (do-MIN-ant), and the minor test ran first, so every dominant type —
  `dominant seventh`, `dominant ninth`, `dominant thirteenth`, `dominant flat
  ninth`, `dominant sharp ninth` and `lydian dominant seventh` — resolved to
  min7. This is the whole shipped dominant vocabulary,
  and it is what `resolveChord("C7").type` returns.
- **A diminished triad no longer renders minor voicings.** `"diminished"`
  contains `"min"` too. `dim7` and the half-diminished spellings were answered
  earlier and were correct; the bare triad fell through to min7. It now returns
  no quality, like the major and minor triads.
- **Minor shorthand is read as minor.** `m7`, `m9`, `m11`, `m13` contain
  neither `"min"` nor `"minor"`, so they reached the digit catchall and came
  out dom7 (`m11` returned nothing at all). This is reachable from chordl's own
  code, not only from external callers: `buildSpecialChord` emits the literal
  type `m6/9` for any `Xm6/9`, and every call site passes `.type` straight
  through.
- **Uppercase-M shorthand stays major.** Lowercasing destroys the one signal
  separating `M7` (major) from `m7` (minor), so it is now tested before the
  lowercase pass — including tonal's altered aliases `M69` and `M7#11`, which
  an anchored test let fall through into the minor branch. `M7b5` still reads
  as half-diminished, which is the only established meaning of that symbol.
**Added:** `maj7b5`, `add9`, `madd9`, `add11`, `madd11`, `5`, `sus2` and
`mMaj7` join `VoicingQuality`, and `VOICING_LIBRARY` gains entries
for the five qualities that had none.

- **A chord with an added tone is a triad plus that tone, not a dominant.**
  `add9`, `Madd9`, `add2` and the bare `2` are a major triad plus the 9th;
  `madd9` is a minor one. `add4`/`add11` and `madd4`/`madd11` carry the 11th.
  They have no seventh at all, which is what an add chord is defined by — but
  the digit catchall saw the 9 or the 11 and answered dom7, putting a b7 into
  them. Major or minor comes from the original spelling, since `Madd9` and
  `madd9` are different chords and differ only by that capital. An altered add
  (`addb9`, `+add9`) has no matching quality and returns none rather than a
  voicing that would contradict it.
- **`5` is a power chord: root, fifth, octave.** Also written `no3`, and named
  `fifth` by tonal. It had no quality and no voicing.
- **`sus2` is its own chord.** 1 2 5, not the 1 4 5 of sus4 — the sus4 voicings
  are quartal stacks on a fourth and a minor seventh, neither of which a sus2
  contains. `sus24`, which really does have a fourth, still reads as sus4.
- **The minor/major seventh has its own quality.** It was answered with min7
  as the nearest thing the library carried, which meant `CmMaj7` — C Eb G B —
  was voiced with a Bb. It now has `mMaj7` and voicings that sound the natural
  seventh the chord is named for.
- **`add6` and `add13` are the sixth chord** they always were, rather than dom7.
- **Every quality the mapper can return now has a voicing.** `min6`, `m6/9`,
  `6/9` and `dim7` were reachable but carried no entries, so a chord identified
  correctly resolved to nothing at all. Twelve entries are added, using the
  chord's own tones — no seventh on a sixth chord, no perfect fifth on a
  flat-five one.
- **`M7b5` is its own chord.** Tonal's major seventh flat five is 1 3 b5 7; it
  was being lowercased into `m7b5` and answered as a half-diminished, which is
  1 b3 b5 b7 — a different third and a different seventh. It now has its own
  quality and its own voicings.
- **The `o` and `°` diminished symbols resolve.** `o7` and `°7` are the same
  chord as `dim7` and carry none of its letters, so they fell to the digit
  catchall and were answered as dominants. The bare `o`/`°` is the diminished
  triad and has no seventh voicing. `oM7` and `o7M7` are diminished triads
  carrying a *major* seventh — the minor/major shape with a lowered fifth — and
  are read as minor.
- **`ø`, `h` and `h7` resolve as half-diminished.** Matched whole, since a bare
  "h" appears inside "seventh", "eleventh" and "half".
- **Fixed a voicing that contradicted itself.** `drop24-m7b5` opened on a major
  third in a half-diminished chord: its lowest interval was `-8` where the
  comment — and the chord — called for the flat five an octave down, `-6`. A new
  test checks every entry in the library for notes that contradict its quality.
- **The jazz major-seventh symbols are read as major sevenths.** `^7`, `^9`,
  `^13`, `Δ9`, `ma7` and their altered forms carry no "maj" for the major test
  to find, so they fell to the digit catchall and were answered with *dominant*
  voicings — a b7 against the chord's natural 7. A bare `^` is still the major
  triad it actually is.
- **Every minor/major seventh spelling is now minor.** The canonical name
  contains "minor" and resolved, but the shorthand scattered: `mMaj7` and
  `-maj7` contain "maj" and landed in the major branch, while `mM7`, `mΔ`,
  `-Δ7` and `m/M7` fell through to dominant. One chord had three different
  answers depending on how it was written. `mMaj7b6` and `mb6M7` come with it —
  whether the added tone is read as a b6 or as the raised fifth it sounds like,
  the chord is minor either way.
- **A sus chord with a major seventh gets no voicing rather than a wrong one.**
  The sus4 entries are quartal stacks built on a minor seventh, so answering
  `M7sus4` or `M9sus4` with one sounds a b7 against the natural 7 those chords
  are named for. There is no maj7sus4 quality to return.
- **An altered degree is no longer read as a quality.** `major seventh flat
  sixth` contains the word "sixth" and `6#11` contains "11", but in both the
  number is an alteration inside another chord, not the chord's own quality.
  The same applies to the digit in `mMaj7b6`. Answering them with a sixth
  voicing dropped the seventh and added a sixth the chord does not contain.
- **Tonal's dash spelling of minor is read as minor.** `-7`, `-9`, `-11`,
  `-13`, `-6`, `-69` and `-7b5` are the same shorthand as the `m` forms and
  were falling to the dominant catchall.
- **Spelled-out and bare names resolve.** Tonal names several chords with no
  digit to match: `sixth`, `minor sixth`, `sixth added ninth`, `eleventh`. The
  bare `69` alias was also being claimed by the digit catchall as dom7.

Note for consumers: `min6`, `m6/9`, `6/9` and `dim7` are now returned where
they were previously mis-answered, but `VOICING_LIBRARY` carries no entries for
those qualities yet, so `findVoicing` returns nothing for them. A sixth chord
that used to render a wrong (minor-seventh) voicing now renders none until the
library gains them. `VoicingVariantToggle` falls through to its inversion and
algorithmic variants; a call passing a style hint logs the usual
"No voicing found" warning.

Known gap, unchanged: a triad with an added tone and no seventh (`add9`,
`add13`, `+add9`) is still claimed by the digit catchall and answered as dom7.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Parser: single-note hand assignments.** Inputs like `Bb in lh, D F Bb in rh`, `lh: Bb rh: D F Bb`, and `left Bb right D F Bb` now parse correctly with both hand groups intact. Previously the single-note hand group was dropped and the orphaned note was misread as the chord name (worst case: `left Bb right D F Bb` resolved chordName `E`). Chord symbols like `G7 in lh` / `Bb7 in lh` still parse as chord symbols, not notes.
- **Board: editing a card now updates the board live.** While a card is in edit mode, changes to the input, title, subtitle, footer, and annotation toggles propagate back to the card on the board as you type.
- **Board: drag-and-drop sorting now actually sorts.** The card's `draggable` flag was tied to a ref, so React never re-rendered with `draggable={true}` and HTML5 drag never fired. Swapped to state.

### Changed

- **Board drag handle** is now the conventional 3×2 dot grid icon, always visible to advertise drag-to-reorder. Still hidden in PNG/PDF exports.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Board: JSON export / import.** Round-trip a board through a `chordl.board/v1` JSON file — items, meta, and an optional sha256 `cacheKey` (computed the same way as `ph-chordl`) for future ph-apps lookup. Toolbar gets **JSON** and **Import** buttons next to PNG/PDF.
- **Board: card selection.** Click a card to select it; click the background to clear. Action chrome (edit, copy, cut, **repeat**, delete) fades in on hover and stays sticky while a card is selected. Selected cards get a blue ring.
- **Board: repeat (duplicate) action.** Clones the selected card and inserts it right after the source.
- **Board: scoped drag handle.** Drag is now armed by `mousedown` on the hand icon — the rest of the card body no longer steals drags from text/clicks.

### Changed

- **Board exports.** PNG/PDF capture now hides the drag handle and the action button row, so exports show only chords + their annotations (no edit/delete UI).
- **Board title / subtitle.** Now render as semantic `<h1>` / `<h3>`, centered.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Parser: many more ways to define two-hand note strings.** `parseChordDescription` now accepts:
  - Hand-prefix without "notes": `lh: Eb Gb Bb rh: Db Eb F Gb` (colon optional)
  - Long-form hand words: `left ... right ...`, `bottom ... top ...`, `bass ... treble ...`
  - Polychord `//` separator (top over bottom = rh over lh): `Eb Gb Bb // Db Eb F Gb`
  - Semicolon separator (reading order = lh then rh): `Eb Gb Bb; Db Eb F Gb`
  - Parens + hand suffix: `(Eb Gb Bb) lh (Db Eb F Gb) rh`
  - Bare suffix without "in": `Eb Gb Bb lh, Db Eb F Gb rh`

### Fixed

- **chord-resolver tests** updated to reflect the resolver's actual (and intentional) flat-spelling behavior — `Cm` first inversion is `[Eb, G, C]` and `Bbmaj7` resolves to `[Bb, D, F, A]`. Forcing flats→sharps would mangle display, so the tests were wrong, not the code.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Parser: `notes in <hand> <notes>` prefix form.** `parseChordDescription` now accepts inputs like `notes in lh Eb Gb Bb notes in rh Db Eb F Gb` and emits the expected `notesGroups` with correct hand assignments. The existing suffix form (`notes C E G in lh`) is unchanged.

### Changed

- **Dev playground:** Chord Details panel restyled — white background at 40% opacity with a light-blue glow shadow — and the summary now reads "Choose more chord details".

## 0.3.1 — 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Bundled SMuFL fonts.** `@pepperhorn/chordl-react` now embeds 6-codepoint subsets of Bravura and Petaluma (~7.5KB total) and auto-injects `@font-face` rules at module load. Consumers no longer need to host woff2 files or declare `@font-face` themselves.
- Font families renamed to `PHBravura` / `PHPetaluma` per the OFL Reserved Font Name clause; `fontFamily` stacks fall back to `Bravura` / `Petaluma` so consumers who provide the full fonts still override the bundled subset.
- OFL.txt shipped alongside the package.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-14

### Breaking

- **Renamed packages** with a `chordl-` prefix to make room for other `@pepperhorn/*` product lines:
  - `@pepperhorn/voicings` → `@pepperhorn/chordl-voicings`
  - `@pepperhorn/core` → `@pepperhorn/chordl-core`
  - `@pepperhorn/react` → `@pepperhorn/chordl-react`

  The old packages are deprecated on npm and point to the new names. Update imports accordingly.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-12

### Breaking

- **Renamed packages** to the `@pepperhorn` scope:
  - `@better-chord/voicings` → `@pepperhorn/voicings`
  - `@better-chord/core` → `@pepperhorn/core`
  - `@better-chord/react` → `@pepperhorn/react`

  Update any imports in your application accordingly.

### Added

- New types exported from `@pepperhorn/react`: `VariationContext`, `RenderVariationExtras`, `OnVariation`.
- New optional props on `PianoChord`, `VoicingVariantToggle`, `ChordGroup`, `ProgressionView`, and `ChordSheet`:
  - `onVariation?: (ctx: VariationContext) => void` — fires post-render once per `(chord, voicing)` cell. Use it to capture rendered notes + SVG markup.
  - `renderVariationExtras?: (ctx: VariationContext) => ReactNode` — render arbitrary children (rating UI, debug overlays, etc.) alongside each variation cell.

  Both props are fully backwards compatible — when absent, behavior is unchanged.

- First publish to public npm under the `@pepperhorn` scope.
