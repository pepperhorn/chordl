 * "chord up 1 octave" used to extend the keyboard by a whole octave — eight
 * white keys became fifteen — and put the chord at the far right of it. On a
 * board the oversized diagram was then shrunk to fit its card and rendered as a
 * letterboxed strip, so the shifted card matched none of its neighbours.
 *
 * The keyboard is a window onto the chord, not a ruler measuring how far it
 * moved: the window moves with the chord and stays the same size. The octave is
 * carried by the staff, by MIDI note names and by playback.
